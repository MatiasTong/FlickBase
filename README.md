# FlickBase

A cool project I built to experiment with managing state in react using reducers and using the material ui component library and other packages like the react infinite scroll component and react palette. This movie search app calls different endpoints from The Movie Database API. To view the live demo, visit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLyla1Kzx6w&feature=youtu.be. You can also try it out at https://flickbase.netlify.app/

To run this app, just fork the repository, navigate in the terminal to the "client" folder of this repo, hit "npm install", and then "npm start" to run.
